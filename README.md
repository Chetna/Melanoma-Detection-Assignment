# Melanoma-Detection-Assignment

# Project Name
- This project is an assignment where a CNN model is developed to detect melanoma, a type of cancer. 

**Business Goal:**
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
    - Objective: To build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) in TensorFlow for the accurate detection of melanoma, a form of skin cancer responsible for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths.

    - Problem Statement:Develop a CNN-based model to detect melanoma early, assisting dermatologists by reducing manual effort in diagnosis through image evaluation.

    - Dataset:
        - Contains 2,357 images of both malignant and benign skin conditions.
        - Sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
        - Includes the following skin diseases:
            - Actinic keratosis
            - Basal cell carcinoma
            - Dermatofibroma
            - Melanoma
            - Nevus
            - Pigmented benign keratosis
            - Seborrheic keratosis
            - Squamous cell carcinoma
            - Vascular lesion
        - Melanoma and mole images slightly dominate the dataset.
    - Impact:
        - The model has the potential to aid in the early detection of melanoma, significantly improving patient outcomes through timely diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- Successfully eliminated overfitting and achieved a satisfactory accuracy by implementing the following techniques:
    - Data augmentation
    - Addressing class imbalance
    - Incorporating dropout layers
